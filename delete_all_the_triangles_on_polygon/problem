There is a polygon. And some of the vertices are connected so that the
polygon is divised into triangles.
Find minimal number of edges to delete in order to destroy all the triangles

INPUT
number_of_vertices_in_the_polygon
u[1] v[1] -- additional edges to form a triangle
u[2] v[2]
...
u[n-3] v[n-3]

OUTPUT
Mimum number of edges we should delete in order to destroy all the triangles
