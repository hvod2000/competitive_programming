Build pairs of routes with minimized number of common shared risk link groups in
a communication network.

While constructing an optical communication network, it may turn out that
several optical cables are simultaneously exposed to some hazard:
for example, they run in the same tunnel and will be disconnected at the same
time if the tunnel is flooded. In such cases, we say that the set of these
cables has a shared risk link group (SRLG), and a specific number (a color) is
assigned to the hazard factor.

We can think of a communication network as a connected, undirected, weighted
simple graph $G$. The vertices of this graph are transmitters which can exchange
signals with each other along undirected edges which represent optical cables.
The communication network has the following property: for each shared risk link
group, all cables of the group lie close enough to a certain cable of the
network. Below we will describe the problem statement in more detail.

For each cable in the network, its length and a set of risks of no more than 16
numbers are known. For several pairs $(s, t)$, it is necessary to deliver the
signal from the source $s$ to the receiver $t$. To do so, one has to build a
pair of main and backup routes with the least number of common shared risks, and
among all such pairs, a pair with the smallest possible sum of lengths of the
routes is preferred.
